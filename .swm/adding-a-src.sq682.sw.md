This document describes what a Src is and how to create a new one.

Some examples of `ðŸ“„ src`s are `ðŸ“„ src/Api`, `ðŸ“„ src/ApiInterface`, and `ðŸ“„ src/ApiLoader`.

## TL;DR - How to add `ðŸ“„ src`s

1.  Create a new directory under `ðŸ“„ src`Â 
    
    *   e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices`
        
2.  Create `CMakeLists.txt` (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/CMakeLists.txt`)
    
    1.  Create the src project (e.g. `ClientServices`[<sup id="o37E7">â†“</sup>](#f-o37E7)) and the src target (e.g. `ClientServices`[<sup id="1B75sm">â†“</sup>](#f-1B75sm))
        
3.  Create `include` (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include`)
    
    1.  Create the src directory (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include/ClientServices`)
        
4.  **Profit** ðŸ’°
    

# Full walkthrough

Start by creating a new directory under `ðŸ“„ src`. We'll follow `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices` as an example.




## Create file `CMakeLists.txt`

Create file `CMakeLists.txt` (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/CMakeLists.txt`) under the new directory.

### Implement the src project and the src target

Here is how we do it for `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices`:

â¬œ 6      add_library(ClientServices STATIC)
â¬œ 7      
â¬œ 8      target_include_directories(ClientServices PUBLIC
```

ðŸŸ© 6      add_library(ClientServices STATIC)
â¬œ 7      
â¬œ 8      target_include_directories(ClientServices PUBLIC
â¬œ 9              ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/include)
```

<br/>

## Create directory `include`

Create directory `include` (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include`) under the new directory.

### Create directory the src directory

Create directory the src directory (e.g. `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include/ClientServices`) under the new directory.

Some examples of files under ClientServices are `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include/ClientServices/CrashManager.h`, `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include/ClientServices/ProcessClient.h`, and `ðŸ“„ src/ClientServices/include/ClientServices/ProcessManager.h`
