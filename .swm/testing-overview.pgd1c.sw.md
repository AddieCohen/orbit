## Running Tests Locally

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, [null](#text-placeholder-id-473b) tests the [null](#text-placeholder-id-4e5e) feature.

[null](#text-placeholder-id-454f)
